- Mastering The Framework</h3>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">SNMP sweeps are often a good indicator
in finding a ton of
information about a specific system or actually compromising the remote
device. If you can find a Cisco device running a private string for
example, you can actually download the entire device configuration,
modify it, and upload your own malicious config. Also a lot of times,
the passwords themselves are level 7 encoded which means they are
trivial to decode and obtain the enable or login password for the
specific device.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Metasploit comes with a built in
auxiliary module specifically
for sweeping SNMP devices. There are a couple of things to understand
before we perform our attack. First, read only and read write community
strings play an important role on what type of information can be
extracted or modified on the devices themselves. If you can "guess" the
read-only or read-write strings you can obtain quite a bit of access
you would not normally have. In addition, if Windows based devices are
configured with SNMP, often times with the RO/RW community strings you
can extract patch levels, services running, last reboot times,
usernames on the system, routes, and various other amounts of
information that is valuable to an attacker.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When querying through SNMP, there is
whats called an MIB API.
The MIB stands for the Management Information Base (MIB), this
interface allows you to query the device and extract information.
Metasploit comes loaded with a list of default MIBs that it has in its
database, it uses them to query the device for more information
depending on what level of access is obtained. Let's take a peek at the
auxiliary module.
