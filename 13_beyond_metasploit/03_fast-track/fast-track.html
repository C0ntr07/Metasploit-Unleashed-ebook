- Mastering The Framework</h3>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fast-Track is a python based
open-source project aimed at helping
penetration testers in an effort to identify, exploit, and further
penetrate a network. Fast-Track was originally conceived when David
Kennedy (rel1k) was on a penetration test and found that there was
generally a lack of tools or automation in certain attacks that were
normally extremely advanced and time consuming. In an effort to
reproduce some of his advanced attacks and propagate it down to his
team, he ended up writing Fast-Track for the public. Fast-Track arms
the penetration tester with advanced attacks that in most cases have
never been performed before. Sit back relax, crank open a can of Jolt
Cola and enjoy the ride.

<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Fast-Track utilizes large portions of
the Metasploit Framework
in order to complete successful attacks. Fast-Track has a wide variety
of unique attacks that allow you to utilize the Metasploit Framework to
its maximum potential. We thought that showing the different attacks
and how Fast-Track integrates with the Metasploit Framework was an
excellent addition and complement to the course. Let's walk through
Fast-Track.
