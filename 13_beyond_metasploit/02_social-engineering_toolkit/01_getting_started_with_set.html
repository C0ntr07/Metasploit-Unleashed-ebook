<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The main thing to understand about SET
is its configuration file.
SET by default works perfectly for most people however, advanced
customization may be needed in order to ensure that the attack vectors
go off without a hitch. The first thing to do is ensure that you have
updated SET, from the directory:

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Once you&#8217;ve updated to the latest
version, you can start tweaking
your attack by editing the SET configuration file. Let&#8217;s walk through
each of the flags:

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Looking through the configuration
options, you can change specific
fields to get a desired result. In the first option, you can change the
path to where Metasploit is located. Metasploit is used for payload
creation, file-format bugs, and for the browser exploit sections of
SET.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Ettercap section can be used
when you're on the same subnet as
the victims and you want to perform DNS poison attacks against a subset
of IP addresses. When this flag is set to ON, it will poison the entire
local subnet and redirect a specific site or all sites to your
malicious server.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Setting the SENDMAIL flag to ON will
try starting SENDMAIL, which
can spoof source email addresses. This attack only works if the
victim&#8217;s SMTP server does not perform reverse lookups on the hostname.
SENDMAIL must be installed but If you're using BackTrack 4, it is
installed by default.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When setting the WEBATTACK_EMAIL to
ON, it will allow you to send
mass emails to the victim while utilizing the Web Attack vector.
Traditionally, the emailing aspect is only available through the
spear-phishing menu however, when this is enabled it will add
additional functionality for you to be able to email victims with links
to help improve your attacks.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The Java Applet Attack vector is one
of the attacks that SET has in
its arsenal that probably has the highest success rate. To make the
attack look more believable, you can turn this flag on which will allow
you to sign the Java Applet with whatever name you want. So say you're
targeting CompanyX, the standard Java Applet is signed by Microsoft but
you can sign the applet with CompanyX to make it look more believable.
This will require you to install java&#8217;s jdk (in Ubuntu its apt-get
install sun-java6-jdk or openjdk-6-jdk).

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When a user gets the java applet
warning, they will see the &#8216;Secure
Java Applet&#8217; as the name of the Applet instead of the IP address. This
adds a better believability to the java applet. The second option will
prompt the user over and over with nagging Java Applet warnings if they
hit cancel. This is useful when the user clicks cancel and the attack
would be rendered useless, instead it will continue to pop up over and
over.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The AUTO_DETECT flag is probably one
of the most asked questions in
SET. In most cases, SET will grab the interface you use in order to
connect out to the Internet and use that as the reverse connection and
IP address for the connections back. Most of us need to customize the
attack and may not be on the internal network. If you turn this flag
OFF, SET will prompt you with additional questions when setting up the
attack. This flag should be used when you want to use multiple
interfaces, have an external IP, or you're in a NAT/Port forwarding
scenario.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">By default the SET web server
listens on port 80 but if for some
reason you need to change this, you can specify an alternative port.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">When using the payload encoding
options of SET, the best option for
Anti-Virus bypass is the backdoored executable option. Specifically, an
exe is backdoored with a Metasploit based payload and can generally
evade most AV&#8217;s out there. SET has an executable built into it for the
backdooring of the exe however if for some reason you want to use a
different executable, you can specify the path to that exe with the
CUSTOM_EXE flag.

<pre style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"># USE APACHE INSTEAD OF STANDARD PYTHON WEB SERVERS, THIS WILL INCREASE SPEED OF<br># THE ATTACK VECTOR<br>APACHE_SERVER=OFF<br>#<br># PATH TO THE APACHE WEBROOT<br>APACHE_DIRECTORY=/var/www</pre>
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The web server used within SET is a
custom-coded web server that at
times can be somewhat slow based off of the needs. If you find that you
need a boost and want to use Apache, you can flip this switch to ON and
it will have Apache handle the web requests and speed your attack up.
Note that this attack only works with the Java Applet and Metasploit
based attacks. Based on the interception of credentials, Apache cannot
be used with the web jacking, tabnabbing, or credential harvester
attack methods.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In some cases when you're performing
an advanced social-engineer
attack, you may want to register a domain and buy an SSL cert that
makes the attack more believable. You can incorporate SSL-based attacks
with SET. You will need to turn the WEBATTACK_SSL to ON. If you want to
use self-signed certificates you can but be aware that there will be an
untrusted warning when a victim goes to your website.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The webjacking attack is used by
replacing the victims browser with
another window and making it look and appear as if it&#8217;s the legitimate
site. This attack is very dependent on timing so if you're doing it
over the Internet, we recommend the delay to be 5000 (5 seconds) and if
you're running it internally, 2000 (2 seconds) is probably a safe bet.

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The command center is the web GUI
interface for the Social-Engineer
Toolkit. If you want to use this on a different port, change this
number. The next option will specify what interface to listen on for
the SET web interface. If it&#8217;s set to 127.0.0.1, it eans that no one
from outside on the network can hit the web interface. If you place it
to 0.0.0.0, it will bind to all interfaces and it can be reached
remotely. Be careful with this setting. The encount flag determines how
many times a payload will be encoded with Metasploit payloads when in
SET. By default it&#8217;s 4, but if you require less or more, you can adjust
this accordingly.
