<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">SET is a menu driven based attack
system, which is fairly unique
when it comes to hacker tools. The decision not to make it command line
was made because of how social-engineer attacks occur; it requires
multiple scenarios, options, and customizations. If the tool had been
command line based it would have really limited the effectiveness of
the attacks and the inability to fully customize it based on your
target. Let&#8217;s dive into the menu and do a brief walkthrough of each
attack vector.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The spear-phishing attack menu is
used for performing targeted
email attacks against a victim. You can send multiple emails based on
what your harvested or you can send it to individuals. You can also
utilize fileformat (for example a PDF bug) and send the malicious
attack to the victim in order to hopefully compromise the system.

<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The web attack vector is used by
performing phishing attacks against
the victim in hopes they click the link. There are a wide-variety of
attacks that can occur once they click. We will dive into each one of
the attacks later on.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>"3. Infectious Media Generator</b>"
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The infectious USB/DVD creator will
develop a Metasploit payload
for you and craft an autorun.inf file that once burned or placed on a
USB device, will trigger an autorun feature and hopefully compromise
the system. This attack vector is relatively simple in nature and
relies on deploying the devices to the physical system.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>"4. Create a Payload and Listener</b>"
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The create payload and listener is an
extremely simple wrapper
around Metasploit to create a payload, export the exe for you and
generate a listener. You would need to transfer the exe onto the victim
machine and execute it in order for it to properly work.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>"5. Mass Mailer Attack</b>"
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The mass mailer attack will allow you
to send multiple emails to
victims and customize the messages. This option does not allow you to
create payloads, so it is generally used to perform a mass phishing
attack.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The teensy USB HID attack is a
method used by purchasing a hardware
based device from prjc.com and programming it in a manner that makes
the small USB microcontroller look and feel exactly like a keyboard.
The important part to note with this is that it bypasses autorun
capabilities and can drop payloads onto the system through the onboard
flash memory. The keyboard simulation allows you to type characters in
a manner that can utilize downloaders and exploit the system.
