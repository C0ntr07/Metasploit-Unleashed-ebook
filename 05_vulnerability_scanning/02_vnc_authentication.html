<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The VNC Authentication None Scanner
will search a range of IP
addresses looking for targets that are running a VNC server without a
password configured. Pretty well every administrator worth his/her salt
sets a password prior to allowing inbound connections but you never
know when you might catch a lucky break and a successful pen-test
leaves no stone unturned.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In fact, once when doing a pentest, we
came across a system on
the target network with an open VNC installation. While we were
documenting our findings, I noticed some activity on the system. It
turns out, someone else had found the system as well! An unauthorized
user was live and active on the same system at the same time. After
engaging in some social engineering with the intruder, we were informed
by the user they had just got into the system, and came across it as
they were scanning large chunks of IP addresses looking for open
systems. This just drives home the fact that intruders are in fact
actively looking for this low hanging fruit, so you ignore it at your
own risk.

in your lab environment, you can download a vulnerable version of

select the auxiliary module, define our options, then let it run.
