<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>Devon Kearns</b> (dookie) formerly
served as Communications and
Information Systems Technician with the Canadian Army. He has served in
Afghanistan working primarily on long-range radio and satellite
communications. A back injury cut his military career short but led him
into a position as an IS Security Analyst in the public service,
allowing him to pursue his true passion in the field of Information
Security while still serving his nation. As a relative newcomer to the
information security world, Devon is working hard at "catching up" and
currently holds the OSCE, OSCP, OSWP, GCIH, GCFA, and GSEC
certifications.
