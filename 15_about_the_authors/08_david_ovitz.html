<p>I've been programming since childhood, and professionally since
about 1999. I've been on the defensive side of security for a long
time, but found I could learn a lot more from the offensive side. I'm
newer to Offensive Security, but it really does help from the defensive
standpoint if you really learn what's going on. I don't have a lot to
say about myself, but this course really is a good one, and I got
involved to help HFC, I think it's a great cause. I also think that all
people involved with computers professionally in any way should learn
about hardware, software, networks, security, and anything else they
can get their hands on. I've found the more you know about the whole
process the more sense each individual part of the puzzle makes.
