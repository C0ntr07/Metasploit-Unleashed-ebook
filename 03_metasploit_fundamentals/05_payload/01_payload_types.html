- Mastering The Framework</h3>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Metasploit contains many different
types of payloads, each serving a
unique role within the framework. Let's take a brief look at the
various types of payloads available and get an idea of when each type
should be used.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>Inline (Non Staged)</b>
</p>
<dl style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>A single payload containing the exploit and full shell
code for the selected task. Inline payloads are by design more stable
than their counterparts because they contain everything all in one.
However some exploits wont support the resulting size of these
payloads.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>Staged</b>
</p>
<dl style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Stager payloads work in conjunction with stage payloads
in order to perform a specific task. A stager establishes a
communication channel between the attacker and the victim and reads in
a stage payload to execute on the remote host.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>Meterpreter</b>
</p>
<dl style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Meterpreter, the short form of Meta-Interpreter is an
advanced, multi-faceted payload that operates via dll injection. The
Meterpreter resides completely in the memory of the remote host and
leaves no traces on the hard drive, making it very difficult to detect
with conventional forensic techniques. Scripts and plugins can be
loaded and unloaded dynamically as required and Meterpreter development
is very strong and constantly evolving.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>PassiveX</b>
</p>
<dl style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>PassiveX is a payload that can help in circumventing
restrictive outbound firewalls. It does this by using an ActiveX
control to create a hidden instance of Internet Explorer. Using the new
ActiveX control, it communicates with the attacker via HTTP requests
and responses.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>NoNX</b>
</p>
<dl style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>The NX (No eXecute) bit is a feature built into some
CPUs to prevent code from executing in certain areas of memory. In
Windows, NX is implemented as Data Execution Prevention (DEP). The
Metasploit NoNX payloads are designed to circumvent DEP.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>Ord</b>
</p>
<dl style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Ordinal payloads are Windows stager based payloads that
have distinct advantages and disadvantages. The advantages being it
works on every flavor and language of Windows dating back to Windows 9x
without the explicit definition of a return address. They are also
extremely tiny. However two very specific disadvantages make them not
the default choice. The first being that it relies on the fact that
ws2_32.dll is loaded in the process being exploited before
exploitation. The second being that it's a bit less stable than the
other stagers.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>IPv6</b>
</p>
<dl style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>The Metasploit IPv6 payloads, as the name indicates, are
built to function over IPv6 networks.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b>Reflective DLL injection</b>
</p>
<dl style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
  <dd>
    <ul>
      <li>Reflective DLL Injection is a technique whereby a stage
payload is injected into a compromised host process running in memory,
never touching the host hard drive. The VNC and Meterpreter payloads
both make use of reflective DLL injection. You can read more about this
from Stephen Fewer, the creator of the <a

method.
