<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">We will be looking at three different
files, they should be relatively familar from prior sections.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">One thing to caveat is that I didn't
need to put different commands in
three different files however, if you think ahead you may want to reuse
code and putting the hex2binary portions in mssql.rb made the most
sense, plus HDM is a stickler for pretty code (love you buddy).
</span>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Let's first take a look at the
mssql_payload.rb to get an idea of what we're looking at here.
<br>
<br>
</p>

<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">While this may seem extremely simple
and not a ton of code, there
is actually a lot of things that are going on behind the scenes that
we'll investigate later. Let's break down this file for now. If you
look at the top half, everything should look relatively the same right?
If you look at the references section, this area is simply for
additional information about the attack or original exploit vector. The
platform of "win" is specifying Windows platforms and the Targets is
simply a section if we wanted to add operating systems or in this
example if we had to do something different based off of SQL server we
could add SQL 2000, SQL 2005, and SQL 2008. The DefaultTarget allows us
to specify a default for this attack, so if we used SQL 2000, SQL 2005,
and SQL 2008, we could have it default to 2005, people could change it
through SET TARGET 1 2 3 but if they didn't 2005 would be the system
attacked.
</span>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Moving to the "def exploit" this begins
our actual code for the
exploit, one thing to note from the above if you look at the very top
we included "Msf::Exploit::Remote::MSSQL" this will include a variety
of items we can call from the Exploit, Remote, and MSSQL portions.
Specifically we are calling from the mssql.rb in the
lib/msf/core/exploits area.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The first line debug = false specifies
if we should portray
information back to you or not, typically we don't want this and isn't
needed and would be quite a bit of information portrayed back to the
Metasploit user. If something isn't working, simply change this to
debug=true and you'll see everything that Metasploit is doing. Moving
on to the next line, this is the most complex portion of the entire
attack. This one liner here is really multiple lines of code being
pulled from mssql.rb. We'll get into this one in a second, but to
explain what is actually there:
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">mssql_upload_exec (function defined in
mssql.rb for uploading an executable through SQL to the underlying
operating system)
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Msf::Util::EXE.to_win32pe(framework,payload.encoded)
= create a
metasploit payload based off of what you specified, make it an
executable and encode it with default encoding
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">debug = call the debug function is it
on or off?
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Lastly the handler will handle the
connections from the payload in the background so we can accept a
metasploit payload.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">The disconnect portion of the code
ceases the connection from the MSSQL server.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Now that we have walked through this
portion, we will break down
the next section in the mssql.rb to find out exactly what this attack
was doing.
