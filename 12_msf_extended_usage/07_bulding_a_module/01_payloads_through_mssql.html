Through MSSQL</h1>
<h3 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);" id="siteSub">From Metasploit Unleashed
- Mastering The Framework</h3>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">In the prior section you saw the basics
of creating a module, I
wanted to show you this module to get an understanding of what we're
about to build. This module allows you to quickly deliver Metasploit
based payloads through Microsoft SQL servers. The current code works
with 2000, 2005, and 2008. These next few sections will first walk you
through how to use this attack vector, and start you from scratch on
rebuilding how I was able to write this payload (and after HDM cleaned
up my code).
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Let's first take a look at how the
exploit works. If you read
through the Fast-Track section already, you would notice that something
similar happens within Fast-Track as well. When an administrator first
installs SQL Server 2000, 2005, or 2008, if they specify mixed
authentication or SQL based authentication, they have to specify a
password for the notorious "sa" account. The "sa" account is the
systems administrator account for SQL based servers and has a ton of
permissions on the system itself. If you can somehow guess the password
of "sa", you can then leverage attack vectors through Metasploit to
perform additional attacks. If you looked at some of the prior
chapters, you saw how to discovery SQL servers through UDP port 1434 as
well as perform dictionary-based brute force attacks against IP
Addresses in order to guess the SQL "sa" account.
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">From here on out, we will assume that
you already know the
password for the MSSQL server and that you are ready to deliver your
payload to the underlying operating system and not use Fast-Track.
